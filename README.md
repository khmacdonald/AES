AES
===

includes/rijndael.h
    Defines the Rijndael algorithm.

includes/rijndeal_field.h
    Defines the field arithmetic for the GF(256) Rijndael uses.

rijndael.c
    Implements the Rijgndael algorithm.

AesMain.c
    Tests the Rijndael algorithm on known test vetors.

rijndael.c
    Implements the field arithmetic.


-------------------------------------------------------------------
The BinaryGalois directory contains old code.  It is a quick
implmentation that I am using to implement better code.

BinaryGalois/includes/gf_8bit.h
    Defines the polynomial for the Rijndael GF(256)

BinaryGalois/gf_8bit.c
    Defines the field arithmetic over GF(256) used for the Rijndael algorithm.

BinaryGalois/RijndaelData.c
    Defines the GF(256) used for the Rijndael algorithm.  RijndaelByPower[1] shows
    that the field is generated by 0x3, with the reduction being 0x100=0x1b, so all
    field elements are between 0x00 and 0xff.

BinaryGalois/includes/Rijndael.h
    Defines the key expansion, encryption, and test functions.

BinaryGalois/Rijndael.c
    Implements the key expansion, AES encryption, and test functions.

BinaryGalois/gfMain.c
    Provides a main function to run the test function.
