===
BinaryGalois/includes/gf_8bit.h
    Defines the polynomial for the Rijndael GF(256)

BinaryGalois/src/gf_8bit.c
    Defines the field arithmetic over GF(256) used for the Rijndael algorithm.

BinaryGalois/src/RijndaelData.c
    Defines the GF(256) used for the Rijndael algorithm.  RijndaelByPower[1] shows
    that the field is generated by 0x3, with the reduction being 0x100=0x1b, so all
    field elements are between 0x00 and 0xff.

BinaryGalois/includes/Rijndael.h
    Defines the key expansion, encryption, and test functions.

BinaryGalois/src/Rijndael.c
    Implements the key expansion, AES encryption, and test functions.

BinaryGalois/src/gfMain.c
    Provides a main function to run the test function.
